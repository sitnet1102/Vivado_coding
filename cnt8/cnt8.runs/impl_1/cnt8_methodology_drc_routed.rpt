Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell s_reg[7]_LDC_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) s_reg[0]_C/CLR, s_reg[1]_C/CLR, s_reg[2]_C/CLR, s_reg[3]_C/CLR, s_reg[4]_C/CLR, s_reg[5]_C/CLR, s_reg[6]_C/CLR, s_reg[7]_C/CLR, s_reg[7]_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch s_reg[7]_LDC cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin s_reg[7]_LDC/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
